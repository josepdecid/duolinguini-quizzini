![Duolinguini Quizzini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josepdecid/duolinguini-quizzini/refs/heads/main/public/duolinguini-quizzini.webp)

A fun Duolingo-inspired quiz game to test your knowledge of Italian memes and internet culture. Match the meme's name with its corresponding image while enjoying the iconic audio clips!

## 🚫 Disclaimer

This project is a fan-made parody and is not affiliated with Duolingo or any other entity or memes that appear here. I do not own any of the meme images or sound clips used in this project. All content is used for entertainment purposes only.

If you are the owner of any content and would like it removed, please open an issue or contact me directly.

## 🐘 Contributing

Want to add more animals to the quiz? Just create a Piull adding your own meme assets. You just need to add the image and the audio file into the `/public/brainrot` folder following these constraints:

- Both image and audio file must have the same file name.
- The image must be a `.webp` file of 150x150 pixels.
- The audio file must be a `.mp3` file.
- Name the files with kebab-case without any special characters, spaces or capital letters.
